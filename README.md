### ðŸ“‘ Ignite | Rocketshoes

---
As part of a challenge from Ignite (*an acceleration program for devs, focused on preparing complete professionals for the market, training technical and behavioral skills in an intensive and practical way*) developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), this project has been built in order to get used to **Context API** from **React** and create a real e-commerce checkout.
Actually, it was nice dealing with **JSON Server** in order to provide a fake API. Also I've worked with cart checkout, handling with the increase and decrease of products amount.

The UI was built by Rocketseat Team and I'd changed it a little bit, only to make different and unique.
